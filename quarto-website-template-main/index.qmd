# Welcome to my website!

I am Gina Lin, and I am from Cincinnati, Ohio. I am a combined bachelor's and master's student pursuing a biochemistry BS and biomedical and health informatics MS at Case Western Reserve University. I am in my third year of undergraduate studies and am anticipated to graduate in May of 2026. I am a part of the biochemistry honors research track and currently work in Dr. Hung-Ying Kaoâ€™s lab at the Department of Biochemistry in the School of Medicine. I am still exploring my interests within the biomedical field. My future goals include pursuing a PhD in biomedical science and going into industry. 
Don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:mail.gina.lin1231@outlook.com) if you have any questions or want to discuss potential collaborations.
