    "text": "Welcome to my blog! I will share some of my insights gathered from my reading.\n\nHow To Be A Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek\nIn Jeff Leek’s novel, he shares a thoughtful perspective on how to approach reading scientific papers, which is something I found incredibly valuable. One of the key takeaways for me is how underemphasized this skill is in traditional education. In my experience, no one ever formally taught me how to read or interpret a scientific paper. I didn’t know what to focus on, how to assess the quality of a paper, or even that there were different types of journals with distinct purposes and audiences.\nLeek emphasizes that academic papers remain the gold standard for distributing new scientific knowledge, even in a world filled with blogs, code repositories, and social media. However, not all journals are created equal. Some, like Nature, Science, or PNAS, aim to present broadly interesting “breakthrough” findings and are more readable, but they can sometimes sacrifice accuracy for impact. Others, like field-specific journals, prioritize technical rigor over general appeal and are often more trustworthy but harder to parse for newcomers.\nReading scientific papers efficiently involves understanding your goals and using a strategic approach. Leek breaks this down clearly: skim the title and abstract to decide if it’s worth your time, then examine the figures to understand the main findings. If the topic is new to you, it’s worth reading the introduction for context. The methods section is where the real science happens, and for anyone interested in evaluating a paper’s validity, this is the most important part to read carefully.\nLeek also touches on accessibility. Many papers are behind paywalls, but there are alternatives—preprint servers like bioRxiv and arXiv, open-access journals like PLoS One and PeerJ, and even author websites. He mentions tools like Sci-Hub and #icanhazpdf, showing that access to knowledge should never be a barrier to learning.\nLeek’s guide made me realize that reading scientific literature is a skill to be developed, not something we’re just expected to know. I now see that reading papers is less about consuming every word and more about learning to identify what’s important, when to dig deeper, and how to think critically about what you’re reading. I only wish this had been taught earlier in my education.\nAnother part of Jeff Leek’s novel that I found especially helpful was his discussion on career planning. It opened my eyes to how little formal guidance on planning for a long-term career in science is often given—especially in academic settings. Much like how students are rarely taught how to read a scientific paper, they’re also not usually taught how to navigate the professional side of a scientific career. I’ve often felt that while passion and curiosity are celebrated in science, career development is treated as secondary or even unseemly to talk about. But as Leek points out, being passionate about science is only one piece of the puzzle; if you want to be a professional scientist, you need to treat your career with the same intention and strategy as your research. Leek stresses the importance of having a clear, realistic career plan, even if your love for science is what initially brought you into the field."
